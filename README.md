# Permutations
A test of an app to deal with permutations (the mathematical objects that show up particularly in group theory)

I created this app while taking an abstract algebra class, in order to simplify the more tedious operations using abstract mathematical permutations. It isn't yet complete, but when it is, it will hopefully be quite useful, at least for a rather restricted group (haha) of people.
